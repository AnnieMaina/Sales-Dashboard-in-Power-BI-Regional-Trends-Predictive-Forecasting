This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis of sales performance for Awesome Chocolates, an organic and wholesome chocolate company. Using Power BI, I transformed raw sales data from January 2021 to January 2022 into a dynamic dashboard to provide key business insights, identify performance drivers, and forecast future trends. This repository showcases my ability to connect, clean, model, and visualize data to answer critical business questions and deliver actionable recommendations.
